### Hello/Bonjour,
I'm a U1 Software Engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC.    
Currently working on: 

1. Porting Grid-Puzzle-Game, which I began creating in plain, command line Java and can be found on my page, to mini2Dx.
2. A two dimensional timer based basketball game in Unity, in its initial stages of development and located in a private repository.

Capable in Java, C, and HTML/CSS.
