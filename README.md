## About Me

I'm a U3 BSc. Major Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence student in Montreal, QC.  I'm passionate about developing creative and innovative solutions to problems, and I enjoy working in teams and collaborating on projects.

- üèãÔ∏è VP Internal: McGill SSMU Powerlifting Club.
- üèê Member: McGill Men's Volleyball Club Team.  I play setter for indoor, and beach during the summer.
- üéπ I play piano, and am currently learning the second half of [this arrangement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMGUeXtmueU)

## Projects

- **Tabulator**: A chrome extension that groups tabs by URL, immediately reducing clutter and improving organization.  Currently awaiting review on the Chrome Web Store. Code available [here](https://github.com/LoganTML/tabulator).
- **Bro2Bro**: A web application based on an app from the TV show Silicon Valley. Created using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and Socket.io. Features chat room creation and sending variations of the word "Bro." Code available [here](https://github.com/LoganTML/bro2bro).
<!--
- **Git 2**: A program initially built for COMP 322 using C++ allowing users to save, compare, search, and restore previous versions of their files.  I am working on expanding it by creating a GUI and allowing it to access multiple files simultaneously.

- **Pong**: A version of the iconic video game Pong created for the final project of COMP 308 at McGill using C, in-line assembly, and OpenGL.
-->
- **ARoom**: Built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame. Enables geolocation-based chat room creation and joining. Developed with a team of three other developers. [Demo](https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/aroom-dzm4in?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress), [Repository](https://github.com/LoganTML/McHacks-2022).
<!--
- **Grid-Puzzle-Game**: A command-line puzzle game created with Java, implementing concepts including File I/O, recursion, user input, abstraction, and data structures (stacks, queues).
-->

<!--
**Study Clock**: A desktop app written in Python allowing users to track time spent studying/working on different subjects each day.

**Home base**: A chrome extension allowing users to save and easily access their most commonly used webpages
**Tab cleanup**: A chrome extension allowing users to automatically group all open tabs by URL, so that duplicates and unused tabs can be managed and deleted.

**RR Network**: A project where I cleaned and gathered data and attempted to visualize the social network between characters in the [Red Rising series](https://www.piercebrown.com/redrisingsaga).

**Course projects: only available upon request**:
- COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning): Implemented ML models and wrote papers on the following topics-
1. Performed a linear regression with both analytical and stochastic batch gradient descent methods on the [ENB 2012 Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/eergy-efficiency-dataset).  Performed a hyperparameter search to determine the best values for train/test split sizes, batch sizes, and learning rates.
2. Implemented a MLP model on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to classify images. Tested its performance with differing numbers of layers (0, 1, 2), activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Leaky ReLU), and L1 vs L2 regularization.
3. Performed classification on the [IMDb review dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) using both Naive Bayes and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models. Used ADAM as an optimizer for BERT. Tested the performance of different train/test split sizes on the Naive Bayes model.
4. Attempted to reproduce the results of the paper [Deep
Fair Clustering for Visual Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Li_Deep_Fair_Clustering_for_Visual_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) on the datasets MNIST, RMNIST, and USPS.
- COMP 424 (Artificial Intelligence): IP
- COMP 421 (Database Systems): 
1. Designed, implemented, and refined a relational database schema in DB2 to store information for a soccer tournament based on a set of user requirements. Using JDBC, built a Java interface for performing CRUD operations.
2. Other areas of study: Entity-Relationship modelling, Relational Algebra, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Buffer Management, Indexing, Query Evaluation, Big Data (Distributed Data Processing with Hadoop, Map-Reduce), Transactions and Concurrency, Graph Databases
- COMP 370 (Introduction to Data Science):
1. 
- COMP 322 (Introduction to C++): Using plain C++, built a local version control system, which saves and tracks changes between versions of a file through the command line.
- COMP 308 (Computer Systems Lab): Using Intel x86 Assembly (TASM) emulated on DOSBOX, OpenGL, GLSL, and glfw3 compiled with CMake, built a game of Pong playable against an "AI opponent" (it used a single if statement to determine where to move).
- COMP 273 (Introduction to Computer Systems): Using a Logism circuit simulator, built a functional CPU from scratch.
