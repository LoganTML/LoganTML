### Hello/Bonjour,
I'm a U1 Software Engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. 

Available on my profile:

1. Bro2Bro, a web application based on the app of the same name from the TV show Silicon Valley.  Using plain HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and Socket.io I created a website that allows users to create and join chat rooms, and send three different variations of the word "Bro" to the other users in their room.
2. ARoom, built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame. Allows users to create and join chat rooms based on their geolocation and proximity to other users, created in a team with three other developers. Links: [Demo](https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/aroom-dzm4in?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress).  The repository used during the development process can be found in McHacks-2022.
3. Grid-Puzzle-Game, which I created in plain, command line Java using concepts including File I/O, recursion, user input, abstraction, and data structures (stacks, queues).
4. C-Demo, a tool allowing users to create and manipulate lists in the command line. Created to review and practice implementing concepts including dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, data structures, and abstraction with the language C.  Nearly complete, I'm still finishing the testing process.


Technical strengths: C, Java, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Unix, Bash


Fun facts:
* I've been playing piano for 15 years.
* I play indoor volleyball for the men's (club) team at McGill University.
* I compete in beach volleyball tournaments across BC each summer.
* Although I have acrophobia I enjoy rock climbing, which I began a few months after the first COVID-19 lockdowns began.
