### Hello/Bonjour,
I'm a U1 Software Engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. 

Available on my profile:

1. Bro2Bro, a web application based on the app of the same name from the TV show Silicon Valley.  Using plain HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Socket.io I created a website that allows users to join a single chat room and send three different types of "Bro"s, which all other online users can see and respond to.
2. ARoom, built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame. Allows users to create and join chat rooms based on their geolocation and proximity to other users, created in a team with three other developers. Demo available at https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/.  The repository used during the development process can be found in McHacks-2022.
3. Grid-Puzzle-Game, which I created in plain, command line Java using concepts such as File I/O, recursion, data structures such as stacks and queues, user input, and abstraction.
4. C-Demo, a tool allowing users to create and manipulate lists in the command line. Created to review and practice implementing concepts including dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, data structures, and abstraction with the language C.  Nearly complete, I'm still finishing the testing process.


Technical strengths: C, Java, HTML/CSS, Unix, Bash


Fun facts:
* I've been playing piano for 15 years.
* I play indoor volleyball for the men's (club) team at McGill University.
* I compete in beach volleyball tournaments across BC each summer.
* Although I have acrophobia I enjoy rock climbing, which I began a few months after the first COVID-19 lockdowns began.
