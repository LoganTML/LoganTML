### Hello/Bonjour,
I'm a U1 Software Engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. 

Available on my profile:

1. Grid-Puzzle-Game, which I began creating in plain, command line Java using concepts such as File I/O, recursion, data structures such as stacks and queues, user input, and abstraction. Currently working on recreating a more scalable version of the game with Mini2Dx development framework.
2. C-Demo, a tool allowing users to create and manipulate lists in the command line. Created to review and practice implementing concepts including dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, data structures, and abstraction with the language C.
3. No-Zero-Days, a website built to streamline the creation of workout routines.  Currently in early stages of development. Will generate routines for users given their specifications (such as muscle groups, equipment available, rep range, etc.), and allow users to create or customize routines to suit their needs.


Technical strengths: C, Java, HTML/CSS



Fun facts:
* I've been playing piano for 15 years
* I play indoor volleyball for the men's (club) team at McGill University
* I compete in beach volleyball tournaments across BC each summer
* Although I have acrophobia I enjoy rock climbing, which I began a few months into the first COVID-19 lockdown.
