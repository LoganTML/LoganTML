## About Me

Hey! Thanks for checking out my GitHub.  I have some projects listed below; please feel free to check them out or look at [my website](https://LoganTML.github.io) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganlabossiere/)!

## Personal Projects

- **Tabulator**: A chrome extension that groups tabs by URL, immediately reducing clutter and improving organization.  Currently [published](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabulator/jmblkmlknemipmflaegcnaiadfpfekbd) on the Chrome Web Store with 7 downloads. Code available [here](https://github.com/LoganTML/tabulator).
- **Bro2Bro**: A web application based on an app from the TV show Silicon Valley. Created using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and Socket.io. Features chat room creation and sending variations of the word "Bro." Code available [here](https://github.com/LoganTML/bro2bro).
<!--
- **ARoom**: Built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame on a team with 3 other developers. Allows users to create and join geolocation-based voice chat rooms. [Demo](https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/aroom-dzm4in?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress), [Repository](https://github.com/LoganTML/McHacks-2022).
- **Git 2**: A program initially built for COMP 322 using C++ allowing users to save, compare, search, and restore previous versions of their files.  I am working on expanding it by creating a GUI and allowing it to access multiple files simultaneously.

- **Grid-Puzzle-Game**: A command-line puzzle game created with Java, implementing concepts including File I/O, recursion, user input, abstraction, and data structures (stacks, queues).

**Study Clock**: A desktop app written in Python allowing users to track time spent studying/working on different subjects each day.

**Home base**: A chrome extension allowing users to save and easily access their most commonly used webpages
**Tab cleanup**: A chrome extension allowing users to automatically group all open tabs by URL, so that duplicates and unused tabs can be managed and deleted.

**RR Network**: A project where I cleaned and gathered data and attempted to visualize the social network between characters in the [Red Rising series](https://www.piercebrown.com/redrisingsaga).


## Course Projects
**Only available upon request**
- COMP 551 (Applied Machine Learning): Implemented ML models and wrote papers on the following topics-
  - Performed a linear regression with both analytical and stochastic batch gradient descent methods on the [ENB 2012 Energy Efficiency Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elikplim/eergy-efficiency-dataset).  Performed a hyperparameter search to determine the best values for train/test split sizes, batch sizes, and learning rates.
  - Implemented a MLP model on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to classify images. Tested its performance with differing numbers of layers (0, 1, 2), activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Leaky ReLU), and L1 vs L2 regularization.
  - Performed classification on the [IMDb review dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz) using both Naive Bayes and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models. Used ADAM as an optimizer for BERT. Tested the performance of different train/test split sizes on the Naive Bayes model.
  - Attempted to reproduce the results of the paper [Deep Fair Clustering for Visual Learning](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Li_Deep_Fair_Clustering_for_Visual_Learning_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf) on the datasets MNIST, RMNIST, and USPS.
- COMP 424 (Artificial Intelligence- IP):
  - Designed and implemented an algorithm using Hill Climbing that will find a solution for the N Queens problem up to N=120.
- COMP 421 (Database Systems):
  - Designed, implemented, and refined a relational database schema in DB2 to store information for a soccer tournament based on a set of user requirements. Using JDBC, built a Java interface for performing CRUD operations.
  - Other areas of study: Entity-Relationship modelling, Relational Algebra, SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Buffer Management, Indexing, Query Evaluation, Big Data (Distributed Data Processing with Hadoop, Map-Reduce), Transactions and Concurrency, Graph Databases
- COMP 370 (Introduction to Data Science- IP):
  - Configured and set up an Apache web server on an AWS EC2 instance.
- COMP 322 (Introduction to C++): 
  - Using plain C++, built a local version control system, which saves and tracks changes between versions of a file through the command line.
- COMP 321 (Programming Challenges- IP):
  - Participated in NP Compete, the ICPC qualifier hosted by the McGill Competitive Programming Club, as well as three simulated competitions as class examinations.
- COMP 308 (Computer Systems Lab): 
  - Using Intel x86 Assembly (TASM) emulated on DOSBOX, OpenGL, GLSL, and glfw3 compiled with CMake, built a game of Pong playable against an "AI opponent" (it used a single if statement to determine where to move lol).
- COMP 273 (Introduction to Computer Systems): 
  - Using a Logism circuit simulator, designed a functional CPU with an ALU and connections to peripherals.
