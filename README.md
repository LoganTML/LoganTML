## About Me

I'm a U3 honours software engineering student passionate about developing creative and innovative solutions to problems. I enjoy working in a team and collaborating on projects.

## Projects

- **Bro2Bro**: A web application based on an app from the TV show Silicon Valley. Created using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and Socket.io. Features chat room creation and sending variations of the word "Bro."
<!--
- **Git 2**: A program initially built for COMP 322 using C++ allowing users to save, compare, search, and restore previous versions of their files.  I am working on expanding it by creating a GUI and allowing it to access multiple files simultaneously.

- **Pong**: A version of the iconic video game Pong created for the final project of COMP 308 at McGill using C, in-line assembly, and OpenGL.
-->
- **ARoom**: Built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame. Enables geolocation-based chat room creation and joining. Developed with a team of three other developers. [Demo](https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/), [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/aroom-dzm4in?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=in_progress), [Repository](https://github.com/LoganTML/McHacks-2022).

- **Grid-Puzzle-Game**: A command-line puzzle game created with Java, implementing concepts including File I/O, recursion, user input, abstraction, and data structures (stacks, queues).
