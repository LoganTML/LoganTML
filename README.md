### Hello/Bonjour,
I'm a U1 Software Engineering student at McGill University in Montreal, QC. 

Available on my profile:

1. ARoom, built for the McHacks 9 hackathon using Svelte, JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and A-Frame. Allows users to create and join chat rooms based on their geolocation and proximity to other users, created in a team with three other developers. Demo available at https://logantml.github.io/ARoom/.
2. Grid-Puzzle-Game, which I began creating in plain, command line Java using concepts such as File I/O, recursion, data structures such as stacks and queues, user input, and abstraction. Currently working on recreating a more scalable version of the game with Mini2Dx development framework.
3. C-Demo, a tool allowing users to create and manipulate lists in the command line. Created to review and practice implementing concepts including dynamic memory allocation, file I/O, data structures, and abstraction with the language C.


Technical strengths: C, Java, HTML/CSS



Fun facts:
* I've been playing piano for 15 years
* I play indoor volleyball for the men's (club) team at McGill University
* I compete in beach volleyball tournaments across BC each summer
* Although I have acrophobia I enjoy rock climbing, which I began a few months after the first COVID-19 lockdowns began.
